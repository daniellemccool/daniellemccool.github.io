## CBS travel app

<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">CBS in-house programmer (intern)</p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Field test **11/2018** -- **12/2018** </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">1902 letters</p>

## CBS field test data

Data being digested by: 

- 2 Research Masters students
- 3ish interns
- Handful of programmers
- At least two professors
- 1 PhD student

## Important bits

<p class="fragment highlight-current-green"> Device information </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Location data </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Track data </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Stop data</p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Daily Questions</p>

<aside class="notes">
Here's the most important bits. 
</aside>

## Important bits

- Location data 
- Track data 
- Stop data


## Location data

- High-tracking mode: 1 measurement per second
- Low-tracking mode: 1 measurement per minute

## Track data

- Start time
- Stop time
- *Transportation mode*

## Stop data

- Start time
- Stop time
- *Stop name*
- *Stop motive*


## Interesting challenges

<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">**Incomplete data** </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Device differences </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Strange sensor measurements </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">Sensitivity vs. battery life </p>
<p class="fragment highlight-current-green">**What is a stop** </p>


## What is a stop?

![test](travel_plot.png)

## What is a stop (lvl 2)

!["home"](home_plot.png)

## What is a stop (lvl 3)

![work](work_image.png)

## Not a stop

- Waiting at a stoplight
- Being stuck in traffic
- Switching Wi-Fi on and having your position change
 
## A stop

- Going from one building to another on campus
- Taking your dog to the dog park
- Dropping your kid off at school

## ???

- Waiting for your train at the station
- Taking your dog for a walk
- Going to ask the neighbors for your package



## Our stop definition

Two levels

1. Data collection
2. User interface

## Data collection

Parameters trigger 'high-tracking' and 'low-tracking' modes on the device.

1. Distance Delta Limit 
2. Time period within that radius


## User interface

1. **Grouping radius**
2. **Time**
3. Minimum Stop Accuracy
4. Stop merge radius
5. Stop merge max travel radius

<aside class="notes">
- Different because we want to collect data more precisely
- THe fieldtest has two experimental parameters
</aside>

## Grouping radius parameter

![work](work_image_radius.png)

## Time parameter

## Better interpretation

![work](work_image_good.png)

## Missing data

Missing data occurs at myriad levels within this data.

> 1. Recruitment
> 2. App/device incompatibility
> 3. App installation
> 4. App closes itself
> 5. App only has location on Wi-Fi or GPS
> 7. Device dies
> 8. Short losses due to tunnels or buildings

## Missing data in the recruitment phase

![recruitment](p1.png)

## Missing data over time per OS

![recruitment](p2.png)

## Missing data within a day

![recruitment](p3.png)

## Missing data within a trip

## {data-background-image="routegif.gif"}


## Next steps

PhD project consists of five projects (2018-2021):

- A descriptive paper over the app
- Adjustment for missing data in CBS verplaatsingen app
- Adjustment for measurement error/inaccurate measurements in CBS verplaatsingen app
- Two projects linked to time-use sensor data


## Summary

- Goal: critically examine app as diary replacement
- Field test had over 600 respondents
- Self-reported stops are difficult to reproduce programmatically
- Lots of flavors of missingness
- Immediate issues: reporting distance to the stakeholders
