## WIN sensor data projects

- **Travel/mobility**
  - **Stakeholders RWS/KiM**
  - **Location (GSM, Wi-Fi, GPS) ~~and motion sensors~~**
- Time use
  - Stakeholder SCP
  - Location (GSM, Wi-Fi, GPS) and motion sensors
  - Possibly wearables
- Budget expenditure
  - Eurostat project @ HBS
  - Location (GSM, Wi-Fi, GPS) and camera
- Fitness/physical activity
  - Stakeholders RIVM, GGD
  - Wearables
  
## CBS verplaatsingen app
- Fieldtest (Nov-Dec) oriented at evaluation of:
  + Effective recruitment and data collection strategies
  + Quality of sensor data and supplemental survey data
- Analyses
  + Fast to inform CBS and RWS management and decide on follow-up actions
  + Slow to search for effective editing and impotation methodologies and for sensible stop detection rules
- Analyses done by
  + Danielle McCool as PhD
  + Two EMOS students (Katie Roth and Laurent Smeets)
  + Traineeship (Lars Killaars)
  + WIN researchers

## Dimensions of the data

![test](tablespng.png)

## Important bits

- Device information
- Location data
  + 1/sec when moving
  + 1/minute when still
- Track data
  + Start time 
  + End time
  + Mode (user-input)
- Stop data
  + Start time
  + End time
  + Name (user-input)
  + Motive (user-input)

## Interesting challenges

> - Incomplete data
> - Device differences
> - **Strange sensor measurements**
> - Sensitivity vs. battery life
> - **What is a stop**

## What is a stop?




## Next steps

PhD project consists of five projects (2018-2021):
- A descriptive paper over the app
- Adjustment for missing data in CBS verplaatsingen app
- Adjustment for measurement error/inaccurate measurements in CBS verplaatsingen app
- Two projects linked to time-use sensor data
